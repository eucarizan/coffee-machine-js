## learning
this project allows you to get a taste of javascript. practice working with functions, challenge yourself with loops and conditions, and get more experience with js.

## about
what can be better than a cup of coffee during a break? two cups. press a couple of buttons on the machine, and, voilà, a burst of raw energy is in your hands. but first, we should teach the machine how to do it. in this project, you will work on a coffee machine simulator. this machine uses regular ingredients — coffee, milk, and plastic cups. should it run out of something, it will show you a notification. our device will serve espresso, cappuccino, and latte. and since nothing is for free, it will also charge coffee lovers for a cup.

## stages
### 1: making coffee
<details>
<summary>write a program that puts some basic information on the screen. let the machine describe what it takes to make a cup of coffee</summary>

#### 1.1 description
let's start with a program that makes you a coffee – virtual coffee, of course. in this project, you will implement functionality that simulates a real coffee machine. it can run out of ingredients, such as milk or coffee beans, it can offer you various types of coffee, and, finally, it will take money for the prepared drink.

#### 1.2 objectives
the first version of the program just makes you a coffee. it should print to the standard output what it is doing as it makes the drink.

#### 1.3 examples
take a look at the sample output below and print all the following lines.

output:
```
starting to make a coffee
grinding coffee beans
boiling water
mixing boiled water with crushed coffee beans
pouring coffee into the cup
pouring some milk into the cup
coffee is ready!
```
